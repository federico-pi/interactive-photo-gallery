# An interactive-photo-gallery
  Create an interactive photo gallery using Javascript and CSS Grid layout. At the top of the page, there will be a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a cyclable lightbox. This is the 5th project of the Treehouse techdegree.
