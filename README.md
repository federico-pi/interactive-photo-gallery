# An interactive-photo-gallery
Created an interactive photo gallery using Javascript and CSS Grid layout. At the top of the page, there is a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo displays in a cyclable lightbox. This is my 5th project of the Treehouse techdegree.
